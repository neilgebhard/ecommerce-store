## Overview

Hello there! Welcome to my GitHub repository. I am excited to showcase my full-stack web development skills through an E-commerce store with backend admin integration that utilizes the latest technologies. To create this project, I leveraged React, Next.js, TypeScript, PlanetScale, Prisma, Vercel, and Tailwind CSS. This project was created from scratch, showcasing my ability to develop a full-stack web application from ideation to deployment.

My implementation focuses on replicating the essential features of a full-fledged e-commerce application, using such features as user authentication, product management, image uploading, and e-commerce checkout.

The front-end is developed using React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, ensuring an intuitive UI exercising strong UX practices that is responsive and scalable across devices. The back-end utilizes PlanetScale, Next.js, Clerk, Vercel, and Stripe to handle user authentication, store management, product management, and store checkout.
